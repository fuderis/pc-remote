# PC Remote

![AppIcon](readme/icon.png)

PC Remote is a computer remote control system based on an Arduino Nano microcontroller and a TSOP4838 IR receiver. The Arduino board reads signals from a standard IR remote control. A Rust-based application on your PC receives these signals via the board's COM port and executes user-defined actions.

The application provides a graphical interface for managing button bindings, assigning actions, and configuring behavior. You must also specify the COM port number for the Arduino board within the application.


## Features:

* **Control your PC** with any IR remote
* **Flexible bindings**: Assign custom actions to remote buttons
* **User-friendly interface**: Manage all settings and bindings visually
* **Cross-platform**: Works wherever Rust and Arduino Nano are supported


## Getting Started:

### 1. Soldering the IR Receiver to Arduino Nano

Connect the TSOP4838 IR receiver to your Arduino Nano as follows:

* *VCC* (receiver) → *5V* (Nano)
* *GND* (receiver) → *GND* (Nano)
* *OUT* (receiver) → *D2* (Nano)

> Ensure all connections are solid and insulated.

### 2. Flashing the Arduino Nano

1. Download and install the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/).
2. Open the sketch from [/sketch in my repository](https://github.com/fuderis/pc-remote/tree/main/sketch).
3. Connect your Arduino Nano to your PC via USB.
4. Select the correct board and COM port in the Arduino IDE.
5. Upload the sketch to your Arduino Nano.

### 3. Downloading the PC Remote Software

1. Download the latest release of the [PC Remote](https://github.com/fuderis/pc-remote/tree/main/pc-remote.zip) application.
2. Unzip the archive to a convenient location on your PC and install it.
3. Run the executable file to start the interface.

### 4. Configuring Bindings and Actions

> On first launch, specify the COM port number where your Arduino Nano is connected (e.g.: COM3).

Use the graphical interface to add or edit button bindings:

1. Press the 'Add bind' button to create new IR Remote bind.
2. Press a button on your IR remote to show its code. Copy is and paste to 'Code' field.
3. Assign an action from the available list.
4. If the 'Value' field is available, then fill it in:
    * *KeyboardPress*: write key names
    * *BrowserOpen*: write website URL-link
5. You can enable button press repeating if you need.

> You can combine modifiers split through comma (e.g.: Ctrl,Alt,Del).


## Troubleshooting:

* **No signal detected**: Check wiring and COM port selection.
* **Buttons not working**: Ensure the correct IR remote is used and bindings are properly set.
* **Application does not start**: Make sure all dependencies are present and you have the required permissions.
